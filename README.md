# Practical_approach_to_SDR
This section brings down the purpose of getting familiar with the concepts of Software defined hardware and after extensive survey we found that adopting open source software &amp; hardware could be right fit for simulating and further validating the terms with the real time aspects . Hence with such intention Tenet Technetronics have launched a reference book which deals with the usage of GNU Radio and Ettus USRP open hardware for all the real time experiments . Therefore this book should serve as a good practical guide with detailed steps to follow through to reproduce results as mentioned in the experiments. For the practice and implementing purpose, all the GRC files of an experiment is provided in this repository.
